Backup your instagram photos & display your instagram archive. Supports importing to custom post-types & adding custom taxonomies.

== Description ==

In the spirit of WordPress and "owning your data," this plugin will allow you to import and backup your instagram photos to your WordPress site. Includes robust options to allow you to control the imported posts formatting including built-in support for WordPress custom post-types, custom taxonomies, post-formats. You can control the content of the title and content of the imported posts using tags like `**insta-image**`, `**insta-text**`, and others, or use the new conditional tags `[if-insta-text]Photo Caption: **insta-text**[/if-insta-text]` and `[if-insta-location]Photo taken at: **insta-location**[/if-insta-location]`. Add an unlimited number of user accounts for backup and importing.

Plugin is built with developers in mind and has many filters to manipulate the imported posts.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `dsgnwrks-instagram-importer` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Visit the plugin settings page (`/wp-admin/tools.php?page=dsgnwrks-instagram-importer-settings`) to add your instagram usernames and adjust your import settings. If you want to see how how the output will look, I suggest you set the date filter to the last month or so. If you have a lot of instagram photos, you may want to import the photos in chunks (set the date further and further back between imports till you have them all) to avoid server overload or timeouts.
4. Import!
